Title: Where should I live in the United States?

Group Members: Amanda Souza, Xiang Li, Olivia Jarvis

Introduction and Background: When moving somewhere new in the United States, everyone knows if the place they're moving is more hot or cold and what kind of seasons it has. But, there are many other things that may be factors in the decision when choosing a place to live. In our app we will answer the questions:

How much precipitation does this state get?

What types of precipitation does this state get?

How often does this state have severe weather and what type of severe weather is it?

What is the air quality like in this state?

Data Collection: In this app, we use the datasets "US Weather Events (2016 - 2021)" posted by Sobhan Moosavi on Kaggle and "1980-2021 Daily Air Quality Index from the EPA" posted by Jen Wadkins, also on Kaggle. 

Analysis: Using the different interactive plots, users should be able to get a good idea of the weather in different states. The idea is that this app will be used by people choosing which state they want to move to so they can be more informed about the weather in that state.
